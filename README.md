# 🧠 AI-Powered Flashcard Memory Assistant

This project is an intelligent study assistant that automates **spaced repetition** using the **SM-2 algorithm**. It generates personalized flashcards from PDFs using generative AI (Gemini), schedules reviews based on cognitive science principles, and updates flashcard metadata based on user feedback.
